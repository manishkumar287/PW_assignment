1. An API to add a new record to the dataset.
    POST /
   
    body:{
    "name": "Piyush",
    "salary": 20554,
    "currency": "INR",
    "department": "Math",
    "on_contract": false,
    "sub_department": "trignomatry"
}

2. An API to delete a new record to the dataset.
   DELETE /{id}

3. An API to fetch SS for salary over the entire dataset. You can ignore the currency (if not mentioned otherwise) of the salary and simply treat salary as a number.
   GET /getsalarySS

4. An API to fetch SS for salary for records which satisfy "on_contract": "true".
  GET /getsalarySS/contractors

5. An API to fetch SS for salary for each department. This means that whatever youâ€™ll do in Step 3, should be done for each department. The return of this API should have 1 SS available for each unique department.
   GET /getsalarySS/department

6. An API to fetch SS for salary for each department and sub-department combination. This is similar to Case 5 but 1 level of nested aggregation.
   GET /getsalarySS/department-and-subdepartment
